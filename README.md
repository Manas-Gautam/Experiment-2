# Experiment-2
**Aim: - ** To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

**Theory: -**
Certainly! Here’s a theoretical overview of C++ program structure and data types without using code:

### C++ Program Structure

1. **Preprocessor Directives**:
   - These are instructions for the compiler to include files or define constants before actual compilation begins. They often start with a `#` symbol and include commands like `#include`, `#define`, and `#if`.

2. **Namespace**:
   - C++ uses namespaces to organize code and prevent name conflicts. The `std` namespace is commonly used and contains the standard library’s functions and objects. You can use it to refer to standard components like input/output streams.

3. **Main Function**:
   - The `main()` function is the entry point of a C++ program. Every C++ application must have a `main` function, where execution starts. It usually returns an integer value to indicate how the program ended.

4. **Functions**:
   - Functions are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They can take parameters, execute code, and return values. Functions help in organizing and reusing code.

5. **Classes and Objects**:
   - C++ is an object-oriented language, which means it supports the concept of classes and objects. Classes are blueprints for creating objects (instances) and can contain both data (attributes) and functions (methods).

### C++ Data Types

1. **Basic Data Types**:
   - **Integer (`int`)**: Used for whole numbers, both positive and negative.
   - **Character (`char`)**: Used for single characters, like letters or symbols.
   - **Floating-Point (`float` and `double`)**: Used for numbers with decimal points. `float` provides single precision, while `double` provides double precision.

2. **Modifiers**:
   - **Signed and Unsigned**: Modifiers that determine whether a number can be negative (`signed`) or only positive (`unsigned`).
   - **Short and Long**: Modifiers that affect the size of integer data types. `short` typically uses less memory, while `long` uses more.

3. **Boolean Data Type**:
   - **Boolean (`bool`)**: Represents truth values, `true` or `false`. It is often used for decision-making in control structures.

4. **Derived Data Types**:
   - **Arrays**: Collections of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow for indexed access to their elements.
   - **Pointers**: Variables that store memory addresses of other variables. Pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation and accessing variables indirectly.
   - **References**: Aliases for other variables, allowing for indirect access and modification.

5. **User-Defined Data Types**:
   - **Structs**: Group different types of data together into a single unit. Structs allow you to combine data of various types under one name.
   - **Classes**: Encapsulate data and functions into a single unit. Classes support object-oriented programming features like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

### Summary

- **Program Structure**: Includes preprocessor directives, namespaces, the `main` function, functions, and object-oriented constructs like classes.
- **Data Types**: Categorized into basic types (integer, character, floating-point), modifiers (signed, unsigned, short, long), boolean, and derived types (arrays, pointers, references), as well as user-defined types (structs, classes).

Understanding these concepts will help you structure your C++ programs effectively and choose the appropriate data types for your needs.
